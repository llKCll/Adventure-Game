# Adventure-Game
Start in a room and search for the end-room. A message will tell you the route you took and how many steps it took to get there.

### Usage

Use the make file to compile the program. Use the command "make prog" to compile the program to build the rooms with a random start-room, random end-room, and random connections. The "house" is contained in a folder using text files. 

Use the command "make prog2" to compile the actual game. The game will use the most recent created rooms to play the game.
